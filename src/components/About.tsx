            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hey there, I'm the one-person band behind 'HojaRoja Software'. Yes, despite the 'Software' tag, it's just me – fueled by a passion to craft mobile apps with a sprinkle of joy as a hobby.</p>

            <p>I focus on developing Android apps using the power of React Native. I see the apps I create as useful companions, exclusively designed for Android at this point.</p>

            <p>As you might have noticed, my niche is in crafting simple utility apps. My other hobby of learning foreign languages also finds expression in my apps.</p>

            <p>Occasionally, I even venture into creating simple games.</p>

            <p>I sincerely hope that my apps prove to be of great help to you.</p>

            <p>Simplicity and functionality – the essence of my creations.</p>

            <p>Feel free to contact me <a href="mailto:hojarojasoftware@gmail.com">via email</a>.</p>
